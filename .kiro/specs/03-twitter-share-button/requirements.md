# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a Twitter (X) share button to the calendar screen that allows users to easily
share information about upcoming IT study sessions. The share functionality will include a formatted
list of upcoming events for the current month along with the calendar URL, making it easy for users
to promote study sessions to their network.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the calendar, I want to share upcoming study sessions on Twitter,
so that I can promote interesting events to my followers and increase participation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the Twitter share button THEN the system SHALL open Twitter's share
   interface with pre-formatted content
2. WHEN generating the share content THEN the system SHALL include only events from the current
   month that are on or after the current date
3. WHEN formatting event information THEN the system SHALL display each event as "MM/DD [Event
   Title]" format
4. WHEN creating the share text THEN the system SHALL include the calendar screen URL for easy
   access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Twitter share button to be easily accessible on the calendar
screen, so that I can quickly share events without navigating away from the main interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the calendar screen THEN the system SHALL display a Twitter share button in the
   upper right area
2. WHEN the button is displayed THEN the system SHALL use recognizable Twitter/X branding and
   iconography
3. WHEN the user hovers over the button THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating
   it's clickable
4. WHEN the button is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the Twitter share interface in a new
   window/tab

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the shared content to be properly formatted and informative, so
that my followers can easily understand what events are available and when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no upcoming events exist for the current month THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate
   message indicating no upcoming events
2. WHEN multiple events exist THEN the system SHALL list them in chronological order (earliest
   first)
3. WHEN the share text exceeds Twitter's character limit THEN the system SHALL truncate the event
   list while preserving the calendar URL
4. WHEN generating the share content THEN the system SHALL include appropriate hashtags or mentions
   if configured

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Twitter share functionality to integrate seamlessly with
the existing calendar system, so that it automatically reflects the current event data without
manual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are loaded for the calendar display THEN the system SHALL use the same data source
   for the Twitter share functionality
2. WHEN the current date changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update which events are
   considered "upcoming"
3. WHEN event data is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect those changes in the next share action
4. WHEN the system encounters errors retrieving event data THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle
   the error and provide a fallback share message
