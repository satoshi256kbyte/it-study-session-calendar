# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements responsive design for the header buttons in the IT Study Session Calendar
application. The goal is to optimize the header layout for different screen sizes, particularly
mobile devices, by adapting button display and positioning based on viewport size. The X (Twitter)
share button will show only an icon on mobile, while the study session registration request button
will be moved below the calendar on mobile devices to improve usability and prevent header
overcrowding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the X share button to display as an icon-only button so
that the header remains uncluttered on small screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport width is below 640px (mobile breakpoint) THEN the X share button SHALL display
   only the X icon without text
2. WHEN the viewport width is 640px or above THEN the X share button SHALL display both icon and
   "共有" text
3. WHEN the X share button is in icon-only mode THEN it SHALL maintain the same functionality as the
   full button
4. WHEN the X share button is in icon-only mode THEN it SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels for
   accessibility
5. WHEN the X share button changes between modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and not cause
   layout shifts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the study session registration request button to be
positioned below the calendar instead of in the header so that I can easily access it without header
overcrowding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport width is below 640px THEN the study session registration request button SHALL
   NOT be displayed in the header
2. WHEN the viewport width is below 640px THEN the study session registration request button SHALL
   be displayed below the calendar section
3. WHEN the viewport width is 640px or above THEN the study session registration request button
   SHALL be displayed in the header as currently implemented
4. WHEN the study session registration request button is moved below the calendar THEN it SHALL
   maintain the same styling and functionality
5. WHEN the study session registration request button is positioned below the calendar THEN it SHALL
   be visually prominent and easily discoverable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the header layout to remain visually balanced and
functional across all screen sizes so that the interface feels consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport changes size THEN the header SHALL maintain proper spacing and alignment
2. WHEN buttons are hidden or moved THEN the remaining header elements SHALL adjust their
   positioning appropriately
3. WHEN the header is displayed on mobile THEN it SHALL not cause horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN the header is displayed on desktop THEN it SHALL maintain the current layout and
   functionality
5. WHEN transitioning between breakpoints THEN the layout changes SHALL be smooth and not jarring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all responsive header changes to maintain
proper accessibility standards so that I can navigate the interface effectively regardless of
device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buttons change appearance or position THEN they SHALL maintain proper ARIA labels and
   descriptions
2. WHEN the study session registration button is moved below the calendar THEN it SHALL remain
   keyboard accessible
3. WHEN the X share button becomes icon-only THEN it SHALL have descriptive ARIA labels
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the button functionality SHALL be clearly announced regardless of
   position
5. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the tab order SHALL remain logical across all breakpoints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the responsive header implementation to use existing design
system patterns so that the code remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing responsive behavior THEN the solution SHALL use existing Tailwind CSS
   breakpoint classes
2. WHEN styling responsive elements THEN they SHALL follow the existing design system color scheme
   and spacing
3. WHEN adding responsive logic THEN it SHALL integrate with existing responsive utilities and hooks
4. WHEN implementing the feature THEN it SHALL not break existing functionality or tests
5. WHEN the responsive header is complete THEN it SHALL be covered by appropriate unit and
   integration tests
